# My Website

This is a simple portfolio website that showcases some of my programming projects. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It was a fun experience learning how to make dark-mode work and save the preference so it doesnt default back to light mode everytime you change page.

## Projects

These are some of my projects

- **Advent of Code:** My solutions to some problems from the Advent of Code challenge, written in Kotlin and Java.
- **Mitt 2D spel I java:** A simple 2D game inspired by Zelda, written in Java using the RyuSnow tutorial on YouTube.
- **Enkel login hemsida:** A basic login website that fetches data from a database, built using Java and Spring Boot.

## Mobile Compatibility

I had a learning experience getting the CSS to work on mobile devices, and I have tested the website on multiple devices to ensure that it displays properly. If you encounter any issues with the website on your mobile device, please let me know.
